# Amethyst (Developer Build)
 [Support the Developers](https://patreon.com/capuccino) | [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5sHTkKq)

Amethyst is a discord bot built on Python using the discord.py library.

Special thanks to the Amethyst Team for all the contributions.

This branch is for the developer build of Amethyst.

# B..but what's the difference?
This branch includes more stuff like tracebacks and a few more code fixes.
The 'fragment' system has also been renamed to just 'module' as fragments was too corny.
All core commands now have a semi-proper checks (or as i like to call it, Confirm) instead of using ifs.
This branch is most likely gonna be more developped than the Master branch and eventually merged when ready.

# O..okay but, can I use it?
Yes!
Install redis and discord.py's rewrite variant, add your desired token and prefix in `example_config.json`, rename `example_config.json` to `config.json` and boot amethyst.py!

Don't understand how to set it up? Well you can mention me in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/5sHTkKq). 

Default prefix is "test " and can be changed in `config.json`.

# HELP I'M HAVING ISSUES!!!!11!
Open a [issue](https://github.com/awau/Amethyst/issues). 

# Why this branch tho?
Cause I know I am gonna lose the code at some point... Don't judge me.
